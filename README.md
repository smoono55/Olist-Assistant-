# Olist-Assistant-
A lightweight, Gradio-based assistant for exploring the Olist ecommerce dataset. It combines rule-based SQL lookups, fuzzy product search, simple RAG ideas (dataset evidence + optional SerpAPI web fallback), and small LLM steps for intent classification and answer polishing. Built to be easy to run locally for data exploration, demos, and testing.
